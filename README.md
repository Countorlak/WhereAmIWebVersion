# WhereAmIWebVersion
This app is the lowest common denominator for the final project of Mobile App Dev 2.  The requirements were to simply have a splash page and something accepts a street address and shows the result with a marker on google maps.

## Setup
This repository should contain everything needed, including assets, to run from Android Studio. There was never an apk made as that wasn't required. This was all done on Linux but the only transition to a windows machine anyone should see is Android Studio complaining where certain directories are located. Shouldn't be a problem if that was already set properly beforehand.
### Further Notes For Setup
The gradle build version is 2.2.3 which is the highest version at the time of commit.

Android studio version was 2.2.3 and highest version at the time of commit.

Tested on an actual device running Android OS version 4.1.1 (API level 16).
